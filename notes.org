* Mahjong progressive web app
** Mahjong svg canvas class
   has:
*** viewBox - determined by tile size and layout size
*** defs section containing the tile image definitions
** Mahjong tile image class
   has:
*** tile-decoration - the svg which draws the tile decoration
    just the name of the tile decoration def
*** a position - x and y in units of tile-width and tile-height
*** is-drawn - 
*** is-selected - if drawn, is drawn with selected tile or plain tile
*** can-be-selected, is unblocked, ie playable
     actually a property of the layout with the specified tiles removed,
     that is a game state
*** on-click - handler that determines whether to change is-selected
    is:
*** drawn in svg
*** separate base tile and tile decoration rendering
*** separate plain tile and selected tile rendering
*** If defined and drawn in one svg element,
    then shared definitions are unproblematic.
**** Pulling shared definitions from source file
     which in turn use shared definitions
     is awkward for unknown reasons.
     There are multiple layers and versions of shadow
     dom active because of polymer, because of <use ...>
     elements in svg, because of <use ...> elements which
     reference other source files of svg.
** Mahjong tile class
*** draws selected and unselected versions of tiles,
*** detects matching tiles
**** which have identical images
     Most tiles occur with multiplicity 4 in the collection,
     but seasons and flowers only have multiplicity 1.
     seasons match seasons and flowers match flowers.
     Ah, eliminate the four different season/flower tiles, use
     the same tile image for all four, they match just like the
     others.
** Mahjong layout class
*** Defines slots which tiles may occupy
*** Defines which slots are selectable
